hello
We will slowly improve the LLR, using more and more information form remaining codewords
 like this Li uses only information from Ri. Here we use other bits of information slowly in an
 iterative manner and expand the belief that we have, making the belief that we have a bit better
 and better. Let us see a small example for our proposed decoding algorithm. Consider a part of the LDPC
 matrix as shown in the figure.
